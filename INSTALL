1. To install, simply copy pixelsnap.py and pixelsnap.inx into your inkscape
    extensions directory.

    The exact folder may be different on your system, but it's likely to be:
      Linux: ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/
      Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\Application Data\Inkscape\extensions\

2. To add a keyboard shortcut, edit the keybindings file:
     Linux: ~/.config/inkscape/keys/default.xml
     Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\Application Data\Inkscape\keys\default.xml
   or create it if it doesn't exist. The complete file should like something like
   below (it may contain other keybindings). To bind PixelSnap to the shortcut
   Shift-X, add the 2 lines between the horizontal rules:

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <keys name="Inkscape default">
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->
    <bind key="x" modifiers="Shift" action="bryhoyt.pixelsnap" display="true"/>
    <bind key="X" modifiers="Shift" action="bryhoyt.pixelsnap" />
    <!-- --------------------------------- -->
   </keys>


COMMON PROBLEMS

1. I get a dialog box saying "ImportError: No module named inkex"

This is apparently an issue for Inkscape version 0.46. You need to manually
add your Inkscape's extensions modules directory to the top of pixelsnap.py.
Open that file, and find the section titled "INKEX MODULE"


2. I use a Mac/MacPorts, and I get an error about lxml

This is a known problem with Inkscape, and Niels Olson has posted about it
on our email discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/pixelsnap-users/browse_thread/thread/ef3d642b5b47876

If you're technically-minded, that should help you solve the problem.

I'm currently not aware of a simple fix that doesn't require too much
technical know-how, but if you find one, let me know.
